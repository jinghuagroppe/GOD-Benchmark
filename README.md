# GOD-Benchmark - GOD-poj104

GOD-poj104 is the first benchmark for GOD (graph object detection) problem to train and evaluate the GOD models, and is built on the poj104 dataset [1]. It consists of about 52,000 graphs of code divided into 104 groups, and contains two classes of objects of interest: various implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, and printf statements with format string vulnerabilities. 

The GOD-Benchmark contains the following content:

- GOD-poj104.7z	
- training-dataset metadata
- test-dataset metadata
- readme 

The GOD-poj104.7z consists of about 52,000 code graphs divided into 104 groups, and each graph data contains several files:
- .ast file: describes the graphical structure as an edges list.
- .nodes file: stores the features of nodes of the graph.
- .gt fils: provides the ground-truth data if the graph contains objects of interest.
- .anchors file: provides the confidence score for each class for each anchor that contains an object of the class if the graph contains objects of interest.
